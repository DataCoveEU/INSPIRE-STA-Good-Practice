# SensorThings API in INSPIRE

This page is for sharing information and experiences in utilizing the OGC SensorThings API within INSPIRE, with the goal of formalizing an INSPIRE Good Practice for this issue.

## INSPIRE Good Practice



## SensorThings API (STA)

The OGC SensorThings API is an OGC standard specification for providing an open and unified way to interconnect IoT devices, data, and applications over the Web. 

See: 
- [OGC STA Standard](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sensorthings)
- [OGC STA Github](https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings)

## INSPIRE Requirements

For compliance with INSPIRE, data providers must demonstrate complaince with the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. 
Pertaining to the data requirements towards download services, we have shown alignment between STA V1.1 and 
both INSPIRE Environmental Monitoring Facilities and the Observational model in our publication on ["Extending INSPIRE to the Internet of Things through
SensorThings API" doi:10.3390/geosciences8060221](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/8/6/221)
